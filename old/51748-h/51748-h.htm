<p class="caption2"><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE">EDITOR'S PREFACE</a></p>


<p>In view of the prominent part played in the present World War
by torpedoes and submarines, the subject of our <span class="smcap">Extra No. 35</span>
is peculiarly timely.</p>

<p>The original of 1810 is very scarce, only one copy having been
sold at auction in many years: nor are copies to be found in any
but a few of our libraries. Fulton's claims for his invention have
been fully substantiated and some of his predictions, made more
than a century ago, are remarkably interesting, in view of the
events of the past five months. His estimate of our population in
1920 has already been exceeded in fact, and only his plan of affixing
torpedoes to their prey by means of harpoons seems&mdash;for it
was made in the days of wooden ships&mdash;fantastic, in these days of
iron clads. He could not foresee that almost exactly a century
would elapse before his invention would be extensively used&mdash;though
he cautiously says "it is impossible to foresee to what degree
torpedoes may be improved and rendered useful."</p>

<p>In the Joline collection of autograph letters, sold this month,
was an extremely interesting letter of Fulton's, addressed to Gen.
William Duane. A part reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="tdr">
"New York, March 1, 1813<br />
</p>

<p>I am happy to find you continue the firm friend to torpedoes; an infant art which requires
only support and practice to produce a change in Maritime affairs of immence (<i>sic</i>)
importance to this country. Expecting the enemy here, I have not been idle, I have prepared
9 torpedoes with locks that strike fire by concussion, and four with clockwork locks."</p>
</div>

<p>The letter is of great interest throughout, and tells of his plans
for blowing up the enemy or driving them from New York waters,
his regret that he had not enough torpedoes for the Chesapeake;
and contains a list of the cost of various sorts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We regret that we could not secure permission to copy the
whole of it.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To JAMES MADISON, Esq. President of the United States, and
to the Members of both Houses of Congress.</i></p>

<p class="p0">
<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>In January last, at Kalorama, the residence of my friend Joel
Barlow, I had the pleasure of exhibiting to Mr. Jefferson, Mr.
Madison, and a party of gentlemen from the senate and house of
representatives, some experiments and details on Torpedo defence
and attack; the favourable impression which the experiments appeared
to make on the minds of the gentlemen then present; and
my conviction that this invention, improved and practised to the
perfection which it is capable of receiving, will be of the first importance
to our country, has induced me to present you in the form of
a pamphlet a description of my system, with five engravings, and
such demonstrations as will give each of you an opportunity to contemplate
its efficacy and utility at your leisure; and enable you to
form a correct judgment on the propriety of adopting it as a part
of our means of national defence. It being my intention to publish
hereafter a detailed account of the origin and progress of this
invention, and the embarrassments under which I have laboured
to bring it to its present state of certain utility; I will now state
only such experiments and facts as are most important to be known,
and which, proving the practicability of destroying ships of war by
this means, will lead the mind to all the advantages which we may
derive from it. I believe it is generally known that I endeavoured
for many years to get torpedoes introduced into practice in France,
and in England; which, though unsuccessful, gave me the opportunity
of making numerous very interesting experiments on a large
scale; by which I discovered errors in the combinations of the machinery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
and method of fixing the torpedoes to a ship; which errors
in the machinery have been corrected: and I believe I have found
means of attaching the torpedoes to a vessel which will seldom fail
of success. It is the result of my experience which I now submit
to your consideration; and hoping that you will feel an interest in
the success of my invention, I beg for your deliberate perusal and
reflection on the following few pages. Gentlemen who have traced
the progress of the useful arts, know the years of toil and experiment,
and difficulties which frequently pass, before the utility and
certain operation of new discoveries have been established; hence
it could not be expected, that torpedoes should be rendered useful
without encountering many difficulties; and I am aware, that in
the course of farther essays other difficulties will appear; but from
my past experience I feel confident, that any obstacle which may
arise can be surmounted by attention and perseverance: of this
gentlemen will be better able to judge, after examining the following
facts and details:</p>

<p class="caption3"><i>Is a view of the brig Dorothea, as she was blown up on the 15th
of Oct. 1805.</i></p>

<p>To convince Mr. Pitt and lord Melville that a vessel could be
destroyed by the explosion of a Torpedo under her bottom, a strong
built Danish brig, the <i>Dorothea</i>, burthen 200 tons, was anchored in
Walmer road, near Deal, and within a mile of Walmer Castle, the
then residence of Mr. Pitt. Two boats, each with eight men, commanded
by lieutenant Robinson, were put under my direction.
I prepared two empty Torpedoes in such a manner, that each was
only from two to three pounds specifically heavier than salt water;
and I so suspended them, that they hung fifteen feet under water.
They were then tied one to each end of a small rope eighty feet
long: thus arranged, and the brig drawing twelve feet of water, the
14th day of October was spent in practice. Each boat having a
Torpedo in the stern, they started from the shore about a mile
above the brig, and rowed down towards her; the uniting line of the
Torpedoes being stretched to its full extent, the two boats were
distant from each other seventy feet; thus they approached in such
a manner, that one boat kept the larboard the other the starboard
side of the brig in view. So soon as the connecting line of the Torpedoes
passed the buoy of the brig, they were thrown into the
water, and carried on by the tide, until the connecting line touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span>
the brig's cable; the tide then drove them under her bottom. The
experiment being repeated several times, taught the men how to
act, and proved to my satisfaction that, when properly placed on
the tide, the Torpedoes would invariably go under the bottom of
the vessel. I then filled one of the Torpedoes with one hundred
and eighty pounds of powder, and set its clockwork to eighteen
minutes. Every thing being ready, the experiment was announced
for the next day, the 15th, at five o'clock in the afternoon. Urgent
business had called Mr. Pitt and lord Melville to London. Admiral
Holloway, Sir Sidney Smith, Captain Owen, Captain Kingston,
Colonel Congreve, and the major part of the officers of the
fleet under command of Lord Keath were present; at forty minutes
past four the boats rowed towards the brig, and the Torpedoes
were thrown into the water; the tide carried them, as before
described, under the bottom of the brig, where, at the expiration of
eighteen minutes, the explosion appeared to raise her bodily about
six feet; she separated in the middle, and the two ends went down;
in twenty seconds, nothing was to be seen of her except floating
fragments; the pumps and foremast were blown out of her; the fore-topsail-yard
was thrown up to the cross-trees; the fore-chain plates
with their bolts, were torn from her sides; the mizen-chain-plates
and shrouds, being stronger than those of the foremast, or the shock
being more forward than aft, the mizenmast was broke off in two
places; these discoveries were made by means of the pieces which
were found afloat.</p>

<p>The experiment was of the most satisfactory kind, for it proved
a fact much debated and denied, that the explosion of a sufficient
quantity of powder under the bottom of a vessel would destroy
her.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> There is now no doubt left on any intelligent mind as to
this most important of all facts connected with the invention of
Torpedoes; and the establishment of this fact alone, merits the expenditure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span>
of millions of dollars and years of experiment, were it
yet necessary, to arrive at a system of practice which shall insure
success to attacks, with such formidable engines. For America, I
consider it a fortunate circumstance that this experiment was made
in England, and witnessed by more than a hundred respectable and
brave officers of the Royal navy; for, should Congress adopt Torpedoes
as a part of our means of defence, lords Melville, Castlereagh,
and Mulgrave, have a good knowledge of their combination
and effect. Lord Grenville, Earls Gray and St. Vincent<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>, have on
their minds a strong impression of their probable consequences.
Sir Home Popham, Sir Sidney Smith, and Colonel Congreve, the
latter now celebrated for his ingenious invention of Pyrotecnic
arrows or rockets, were my friends and companions in the experiments;
they are excellent and brave men, and from my knowledge
of those noblemen and gentlemen, and their sentiments on this
subject, I can predict that they would feel much disposed to respect
the rights, nor enter the waters of a nation who should use such
engines with energy and effect.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Twenty minutes before the <i>Dorothea</i> was blown up, Capt. Kingston asserted, that if a
Torpedo were placed under his cabin while he was at dinner, he should feel no concern for the
consequence. Occular demonstration is the best proof for all men.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> The morning of my first interview with Earl St. Vincent he was very communicative. I
explained to him a Torpedo and the <i>Dorothea</i> experiment. He reflected for some time, and
then said, Pitt was the greatest fool that ever existed, to encourage a mode of war which they
who commanded the seas did not want, and which, if successful, would deprive them of it.</p></div>

<p>This fortunate experiment left not the least doubt on my mind
that the one which I made in the harbour of New-York in August
1807, would be equally successful. The brig was anchored, the
Torpedoes prepared and put into the water in the manner before
described; the tide drove them under the brig near her keel, but
in consequence of the locks turning downwards, the powder fell out
of the pans and they both missed fire. This discovery of an error
in the manner of fixing the locks to a Torpedo, has been corrected.
On the second attempt, the Torpedo missed the brig; the explosion
took place about one hundred yards from her, and threw up a column
of water ten feet diameter sixty or seventy feet high. On the
third attempt she was blown up: the effect and result much the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span>
same as that of the <i>Dorothea</i> before described. About two thousand
persons were witnesses to this experiment. Thus, in the
course of my essays, two brigs, each of two hundred tons, have been
blown up. The practicability of destroying vessels by this means,
has been fully proved. It is also proved, that the mechanism will
ignite powder at any required depth under water within a given
time. It now remains to point out means by which Torpedoes
may be used to advantage with the least possible risque to the
assailants.</p>

<p class="caption2">PLATE II</p>

<p>Represents the anchored Torpedo, so arranged as to blow up a
vessel which should run against it; B is a copper case two feet long,
twelve inches diameter, capable of containing one hundred pounds
of powder. A is a brass box, in which there is a lock similar to a
common gun-lock, with a barrel two inches long, to contain a musket
charge of powder: the box, with the lock cocked and barrel
charged, is screwed to the copper case B. H is a lever which has a
communication to the lock inside of the box, and in its present state
holds the lock cocked and ready to fire. C is a deal box filled with
cork, and tied to the case B. The object of the cork is to render
the Torpedo about fifteen or twenty pounds specifically lighter
than water, and give it a tendency to rise to the surface. It is
held down to any given depth under water by a weight of fifty or
sixty pounds as at F: there is also a small anchor G, to prevent a
strong tide moving it from its position. With Torpedoes prepared,
and knowing the depth of water in all our bays and harbours, it is
only necessary to fix the weight F at such a distance from the Torpedo,
as when thrown into the water, F will hold it ten, twelve, or
fifteen feet below the surface at low water, it will then be more or
less below the surface at high water, or at different times of the
tide; but it should never be so deep as the usual draught of a frigate
or ship of the line. When anchored, it will, during the flood tide,
stand in its present position; at slack water it will stand perpendicular
to the weight F, as at D; during the ebb it will be at E.
At ten feet under water the waves, in boisterous weather, would
have little or no tendency to disturb the Torpedo; for that if the
hollow of a wave should sink ten feet below what would be the calm
surface, the wave would run twenty feet high, which I believe is
never the case in any of our bays or harbours. All the experience
which I have on this kind of Torpedo is, that in the month of October
1805, I had one of them anchored nine feet under water, in the
British Channel near Dover; the weather was severe, the waves
ran high, it kept its position for twenty-four hours, and, when
taken up, the powder was dry and the lock in good order. The
Torpedo thus anchored, it is obvious, that if a ship in sailing should
strike the lever H, the explosion would be instantaneous, and she be
immediately destroyed; hence, to defend our bays or harbours, let
a hundred, or more if necessary, of these engines be anchored in the
channel, as for example, the Narrows, to defend New-York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span></p>

<p>The figure to the right of the plate is an end view of the Torpedo
H. H shews its lever forked, to give the better chance of
being struck.</p>

<p>Having described this instrument in a way which I hope will
be understood, I may be permitted to put the following question to
my readers, which is, knowing that the explosion of one hundred
pounds of powder, or more if required, under the bottom of a ship
of the line, would destroy her, and seeing, that if a ship in sailing
should strike the lever of an anchored torpedo, she would be blown
up, would he have the courage, or, shall I say, temerity, to sail into
a channel where one or more hundred of such engines were anchored?
I rely on each gentleman's sense of prudence and self-preservation,
to answer this question to my satisfaction. Should the apprehension
of danger become as strong on the minds of those who investigate
this subject as it is on mine, we may reasonably conclude
that the same regard to self-preservation, will make an enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12 </a></span>
cautious in approaching waters where such engines are placed; for,
however brave sailors may be, there is no danger so distressing to
the mind of a seaman, or so calculated to destroy his confidence, as
that which is invisible and instantaneous destruction.</p>

<p>The consideration which will now present itself, is, that the
enemy might send out boats to sweep for and destroy the Torpedoes.
It is therefore proper to examine the nature of such an operation,
and its chance of success. Suppose two hundred Torpedoes to be
placed in three miles of channel, the enemy's boats, in attempting to
sweep for them, would be exposed to the fire of our land batteries,
or necessitated to fight our boats, for whenever they leave their
ships and take to boats, we can be as well armed and active at boat
fighting as they; and thus opposed by batteries and boats, they
would have three or more square miles of channel to sweep, which,
even if successful, would be a work of time, and were they to get
up some of the Torpedoes, they could not ascertain if all were destroyed,
for they could not know whether five or five hundred had
been put down; nor could they prevent our boats throwing in additional
numbers each day and night. It therefore amounts to an
impossibility for an enemy to clear a channel of Torpedoes, provided
it were reasonably guarded by land batteries and row boats.
Added to the opposition which might be made to the enemy, there
is a great difficulty in clearing a channel of Torpedoes with any
kind of sweep or drag, so as to establish full confidence in sailing
through it. It is only they who put them down and know the
number, that could tell when all were taken up. To facilitate the
taking of them up, I have, since <a href="#plate_ii">Plate II</a> was engraved, thought of
a very useful and simple piece of mechanism which, being screwed
to the box C, will hold the Torpedo under water at any given depth,
and for any number of days. They may be set to stay under water
a day, week, month, or year, and on the day which shall be previously
determined, they will rise to the surface; at the same instant
each will lock its lever H so that it cannot strike fire, and the Torpedo
may be handled with perfect safety. Not having time to engrave
this improvement, it shall be exhibited to Congress in a working
model, by which it will also be better understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p>I will now suppose the enemy to be approaching a port; a signal
announces them; our boats run out and throw into the channel two
hundred Torpedoes, set each to 15 days. Should the enemy sail
among them, the consequence will teach future caution; should they
cruise or anchor at a distance, what could they do? They not
knowing the number of Torpedoes which were put down, nor the
day on which they were to rise to the surface, could not have their
boats out exposed to our fire, and waiting from day to day for a
time uncertain. Whereas, our officers, knowing the number which
were put down, and the day they were to rise to the surface, would
have their boats ready to take them in, and at the same time replace
them with others set for ten, fifteen, twenty, or more days.
Viewing this subject in all its bearings, the impression on my mind
is, that it would be impossible for an enemy to enter a port where
anchored Torpedoes were thus used, without their incurring danger
of such a kind, that courage could not guard them from its consequences.
Prudence and justice would warrant their abandoning
such an enterprise; and the probability is, that knowing us to be
thus prepared, they never would attempt it, or should they, and
only one vessel were to be destroyed, we might calculate on its
good effect to protect us from future hostile enterprises.</p>

<p class="caption3"><i>Represents a clockwork Torpedo, as prepared for the attack of a
vessel while at anchor or under sail, by harpooning her in the larboard
and starboard bow.</i></p>

<p>B is a copper case to contain one hundred or more pounds of
powder; C a cork cushion to give the whole Torpedo such a buoyancy,
that it will be only from two to three pounds heavier than salt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span>
water. To ascertain such weight, when it is charged with powder
and the lock screwed on, it is put into a large tub of sea water. C
is to have fifteen or twenty inch-holes bored in its sides and top, to
let the water rush in and the air out, otherwise, the air would prevent
its immediately sinking. A is a cylindric brass box, about
seven inches diameter and two inches deep, in which there is a gun-lock
with a barrel two inches long, to receive a charge of powder and
a wad, which charge is fired into the powder of the case B. In the
brass box A there is also a piece of clockwork moved by a spring,
which being wound up and set, will let the lock strike fire in any
number of minutes which may be determined within one hour. K
is a small line fixed to a pin, which pin holds the clockwork inactive;
the instant the pin is withdrawn the clockwork begins to move, and
the explosion will take place in one, two, three, or any number of
minutes for which it has been set; the whole is so made as to be
perfectly tight and keep out the water, although under a pressure
of twenty-five or thirty perpendicular feet. D is a pine box two
feet long, six or eight inches square, filled with cork; it is ten or
fifteen pounds lighter than water, and floats on the surface; the line
from it to the Torpedo is the suspending line, which must be of a
length in proportion to the estimated draft of water of the vessel
to be attacked; vessels of a certain number of guns usually draw
within a few feet of the same draft of water; the suspending line
should be from four to eight feet longer than the greatest draft of
the vessel, that it may bend round the curve of her side, and lay the
Torpedo near her keel. From the Torpedo and the float D, two
lines, each twenty feet long, are united at E, from thence one line
goes to the harpoon, the total length of the line from the Torpedo
to the harpoon being about fifty feet, according to the length of the
vessel to be attacked, will, when the ship is harpooned in the bow,
bring the Torpedo under her bottom near midship. See the harpoon.
It is a round piece of iron, half an inch diameter and two
feet long, the butt one inch diameter, the exact calibre of the harpoon-gun;
in the head of the harpoon there is an eye, the point six
inches long is barbed, the line of the Torpedo is spliced into the
eye of the harpoon, a small iron or tough copper link runs on the
shaft of the harpoon, to the link the Torpedo-line is also tied, and
at such a distance, that when the harpoon is in the gun it will form
a loop as at H, but when fired, the link will slide along to the butt
of the harpoon, and, holding the rope and harpoon parallel to each
other, the rope will act like a tail or rod to a rocket, and guide it
straight; without this precaution, the butt of the harpoon would
turn foremost, and make a very uncertain shot. F is the harpoon-gun,
made strong, and to work on a swivel in a stanchion fixed in
the stern-sheets of a boat. My experience with this kind of harpoon
and gun, is, that I have harpooned a target of six feet square
fifteen or twenty times, at the distance of from thirty to fifty feet,
never missing, and always driving the barbed point through three
inch boards up to the eye, which practice was so satisfactory, that
I did not consider it necessary to repeat it. The object of harpooning
a vessel on the larboard and starboard bow, is, to fix one end
of the Torpedo-line, then, if the ship be under sail, her action
through the water will draw the Torpedo under her; if she be at
anchor, the tide will drive it under her, where, at the expiration of
the time for which the clockwork was set, the explosion will destroy
her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15 </a></span></p>

<p>This being the kind of Torpedo and clockwork by which the
<i>Dorothea</i> in Walmer roads, and the brig in New-York harbour
were blown up, and the harpoon having succeeded to fix the line
to the target, these two experiments shall be combined, and the
mode of practice, with the prospect of success and risque to the
assailants, examined.</p>

<p>Represents the stern of a row-boat; a platform about four
feet long, three feet wide, is made on her stern on a level with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
gunwale, and projecting over the stern fifteen or eighteen inches,
so that the Torpedo, in falling into the water, may clear the rudder.
On the platform, the Torpedo and its suspending line of cork are to
be laid, and the harpoon-line carefully coiled as at F, so that when
the harpoon is fired, the line may develope with ease: very pliable
well greased, or white line would be best for this purpose. The
harpoon and gun are so well engraved as require no explanation.
B is the copper case to hold one hundred or one hundred and fifty
pounds of powder. C, the box of cork to diminish its tendency to
sink and bring it to a specific gravity of only two or three pounds
more than sea-water. Its suspending box of cork explained in
<a href="#plate_iii">Plate III</a> is not seen in this figure, lest the drawing should be confused;
it can be imagined in its proper place. A, is the brass box
with the clockwork lock; D, the pin which prevents the clockwork
moving; the line from the pin is tied to a bolt, or otherwise fixed to
the boat as at E. Thus fastened, when the Torpedo is pulled into
the water, the pin D will remain in the boat, and the clockwork
will begin to act. The man who shall be stationed at the gun, and
who may be called the harpooner, is to steer the boat and fire
when sufficiently near. If he fixes his harpoon in the bow of the
enemy, it will then only be necessary to row away; the harpoon and
line being fixed to the ship, will pull the Torpedo out of the boat,
and at the same instant set the clockwork in motion. This reduces
the attack of each boat to one simple operation, that only of
firing with reasonable attention. Should the harpooner miss the
ship, he can save his Torpedo and return to the attack. While I
was with the British blockading fleet off the coast of Boulogne in
1804 and 1805, I acquired some experience on the kind of row-boat
best calculated for active movements, and which I now believe
well adapted to a harpooning and Torpedo attack; hence I propose
clinker-built boats, each twenty-seven feet long, six feet extreme
breadth of beam, single banked, and six long oars; one blunderbuss,
on a swivel, on the larboard and one on the starboard bow; one
ditto on the larboard and one on the starboard quarter, total four,
for which cartridges should be prepared, each containing twelve
half-ounce balls. To work the blunderbusses, in case of need, two
mariners should be placed in the bow, two in the stern; each of
those men to be provided with a horse-pistol and cutlass, and each
oarsman a cutlass, in case of coming to close quarters with a boat
of the enemy.</p>

<p>Such boats would be active well armed, and, if good men, may
be said to be strong handed, and well prepared to make good a retreat,

<p>A, shews a Torpedo, with the harpoon-line fixed to the centre of
its end; when the line is thus fixed, the tide cannot drive the Torpedo
under a vessel, for the pressure of the current being equal on
both sides, it will hang perpendicular to its suspending box of cork
C, <a href="#plate_v">Fig. 2</a>, and remain as at B, where, exploding, it would blow the
water perpendicular to C, and up the side of the ship; the lateral
movement of the water from B to E would give her a sudden cant
to one side, but do her no injury. This has been proved by the
following practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span></p>

<p>On the first of October, 1805, captain Siccombe, in a galley
with eight men and his coxswain, placed two Torpedoes in the manner
described, <a href="#plate_iv2">Plate IV, Fig. 2</a>, between the buoy and cable of a
French gun-brig, in Boulogne roads. The tide drove them until
they both lay perpendicular to her sides. When the French saw
captain Siccombe advancing without answering the countersign,
they exclaimed that the infernal machines were coming, and fired
a volley of musketry at his boat, but without touching a man.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
The moment the French fired, fearing the effect of the explosions,
they all ran aft and were in the greatest confusion. The tide drove
captain Siccombe's boat so far down, that he was obliged to cross
under the brig's stern, where, seeing her men collected, and expecting
another volley, he discharged at them two blunderbusses,
each containing fifteen half-ounce balls<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>, and was rowing away,
when both Torpedoes exploded, but, to his astonishment, the brig
was not destroyed. On the same night, lieutenant Payne, of captain
Owen's ship <i>l'Immortality</i>, placed two Torpedoes across the
bow of another French gun-brig; he received their fire, had one man
wounded, rowed to some distance, and waited till he saw the explosion
of the Torpedoes, which did not appear to do any injury to
the vessel. When captain Siccombe called on me in the morning
and reported these circumstances, I was much at a loss to account
for the brig not being blown up. Defective in the experience
which this failure gave me, I had not reflected, that if the copper
case, with the clockwork and powder, weighed specifically fifteen
or twenty pounds more than water, it would hang like a heavy
pendulum to its suspending cork-box C, and if the coupling line
were fixed in the centre of the end, as at A, <a href="#plate_iv">Fig. 1</a>, the action of the
tide being equal on both sides, would have no tendency to sheer or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
drive it from its perpendicular position. After about half an hour's
consideration, I was forcibly impressed with this error in arrangement,
as the real cause of captain Siccombe's and lieutenant
Payne's failure.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> They had got some idea of these machines, from an attempt which had been made with
them against the Boulogne flotilla, in Oct. 1804, called the Catamaran expedition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The report on this attack in the French papers, acknowledged that the brig had five men
killed and eight wounded: this from two blunderbusses shews that the persons in the vessel attacked
have to fear the small arms of the Torpedo boats.</p></div>

<p>I immediately had a large tub made, then filling a copper case
with powder, I screwed on to it the clockwork lock, and tied to it
the pine box C, then suspending the whole Torpedo by a line in the
tub of seawater; the end of the suspending line was tied to one end
of a scale-beam. I then filled the pine box C with cork, until the
whole volume of the Torpedo and box of cork would, when just
covered with water, hold three pounds in equilibrio in the scale on
the other end of the beam. The Torpedo being then three pounds
heavier than water, had a sufficient tendency to sink; and being
so balanced, would, while under water, be easy moved by a slight
pressure to either side. Then, instead of tying the coupling line to
the end of the Torpedo, as at A, I tied it to a bridle, as at B, which
presenting the side on an angle to the tide, the pressure of the current
in the direction of the arrow, would cause the Torpedo to
sheer from B to G. This arrangement perfectly succeeded to sheer
the Torpedo from its perpendicular C, and the side of the vessel to
E, near the keel, a position, near which it should be to do execution.
In this situation, the explosion being under the vessel, would have
a great body of water to remove laterally, before it could get out
by a line curving round her side. The water, when acted on in so
instantaneous a manner as by the explosion of one hundred or one
hundred and fifty pounds of powder, does, for the instant, operate
like a solid body; hence the explosion raises the vessel up with a
great force, acting on a small portion of her bottom, which portion
giving way, is the same in effect, as though a high sea had lifted
her fifteen or twenty feet, and let her down on the point of a rock
of three or four feet diameter. This, I believe, accounts for the
certain destruction which will follow all explosions that take place
near the keel. In all cases when the explosion is under water, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
action will be perpendicular to the surface, as from B to C, for
in the perpendicular, there are less particles to remove, and less
resistance than in any diagonal, as for example, from B to D.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="blockquot">The French papers, giving an account of the attack of captain Siccombe and lieutenant
Payne, acknowledged that the Torpedoes blew up along side of the gun-brigs, but gave them
only a violent shock and cant to one side; they spoke of the engines as things of little consequence
and not to be feared. It is now, however, evident, that they owed the safety of the two
brigs to the trifling circumstance of the Torpedoes not being properly balanced in water, and
the coupling lines not being tied to a bridle, so as to make the Torpedoes sheer under the bottoms
of the brigs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="caption2"><a id="plate_v3" name="plate_v3"></a><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></p>

<p>Is a bird's eye view of a ship of the line, either at anchor or
under sail, and the Torpedo boats rowing on to the attack. I am
sensible that there are strong prejudices against the possibility of
row-boats attacking a ship or ships of the line, with any reasonable
hope of success; I will, therefore, commence my reasoning and
demonstrations by the following questions. What is the basis of
the aggression and injustice of one nation towards another? Is it
not a calculation on their power to enforce their will? What is
the basis of all courage and obstinate perseverance in battle? Is
it not a calculation on some real or presumed advantage? A frigate
of 30 guns is not expected to engage a ship of eighty guns, for every
rational calculation is against her, and to strike her colours would
be no dishonour. If I now prove that all the calculations are in
favour of the Torpedo boats, it shall hereafter be no dishonour for
a ship of the line to strike her colours, and tamely submit to superior
science and tactics.</p>

<p>I will run my calculations against a third rate, an 80 gun ship,
she being the medium between first rates of 110 guns and fifth rates
of 44 guns. I will suppose her to enter one of our ports or harbours
in a hostile manner; her draft of water, when loaded, is twenty-two
feet; her full complement of men six hundred. Were we to oppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span>
to the enemy an 80 gun ship, she would cost four hundred thousand
dollars; we would also have to give her a full complement of six
hundred men. If she engaged the enemy, the chances are equal
that she would be beaten; if an obstinate engagement, she might
have from one to two hundred men killed and wounded, and be so
shattered as to require repairs to the amount of forty or fifty thousand
dollars; she might be taken and lost to the nation, and add to
the strength of the enemy. It is now to be seen if six hundred men
and a capital of four hundred thousand dollars, the value of an
eighty gun ship, cannot be used to better advantage in a Torpedo
attack or defence.</p>

<p>The pay and provisions for six hundred men, whether in an 80 gun
ship or in Torpedo boats, may be estimated, for the present, to
amount to the same sum annually.</p>

<p>Here is an establishment of fifty boats with their Torpedoes,
and armed complete, for 24,300 dollars; the economy 375,700
dollars.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> It is evident the ship could not put out fifty boats to contend
with our fifty; she could not, in fact, put out twenty; therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
as to boat fighting, the enemy could have no chance of success,
and would have to depend for protection on her guns and small
arms. Unless in a case of great emergency, the attack should be
in the night, for if an enemy came into one of our harbours to do
execution, the chances would be much against her getting out and
to any great distance before night. In a night usually dark, rowboats,
if painted white, and the men dressed in white, cannot be
seen at the distance of three hundred yards; and there are nights so
dark, that they cannot be seen if close under the bow. I might
here draw into my calculations on chances that an enemy, who
understood the tremendous consequences of a successful attack
with Torpedoes, would not like to run the risk of the night being
dark. But in any night, the fifty boats closing on the vessel in all
direction, would spread or divide her fire, and prevent it becoming
concentered on any one or more boats. Boats which row five
miles an hour, and which all good boats can do for a short time, run
at the rate of one hundred and forty yards a minute. At the distance
of three hundred yards from the ship, they take the risque of
cannon shot, which must, from necessity, be random and without
aim, on so small a body as a boat, running with a velocity of one
hundred and forty yards a minute. At two hundred yards from
the ship, the boats must take the chance of random discharges of
grape and cannister shot; and at one hundred yards from the ship,
they must run the risque of random musket; each boat will, therefore,
be two minutes within the line of the enemy's fire before she
harpoons, and two minutes after she has harpooned before she gets
out of the line of fire, total, four minutes in danger<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>: the danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23 </a></span>
however, is not of a very serious kind, for, as before observed, no
aim can be taken in the night at such quick moving bodies as row-boats;
yet some men might be killed, and some boats crippled<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>; in
such an event, the great number of boats which we should have in
motion, could always help the unfortunate. But what would be
the situation of the enemy, who had their six hundred men in one
vessel? The Torpedo boats closing upon her, twenty-five on the
larboard and twenty-five on the starboard bow, some of them would
certainly succeed to harpoon her between the stem and main chains,
and if so, the explosion of only one Torpedo under her would sink
her, killing the greatest part of the people who were between decks,
and leave those who might escape to the mercy of our boats to

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> As each boat with a Torpedo, and armed complete, costs four hundred and eighty-six
dollars, this economy would pay for seven hundred and eighty-nine boats; hence, eight hundred
and thirty-nine Torpedo boats, with Torpedoes and arms, could be fitted out for the sum which
one 80 gun ship would cost.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> A deduction may be made from this time; after harpooning, if the ship were anchored in
a current which ran one mile and a half an hour, that would be two feet three lines a second;
hence, if the distance from the harpoon to the Torpedo were sixty feet, thirty seconds would be
sufficient for the tide to push it under the keel; its clockwork might be set to explode in one
minute from the time the Torpedo fell out of the boat. If a vessel were under sail, running
more than two miles an hour, one minute would be sufficient time for the clockwork to act
before explosion. After explosion there would, of course, be no resistance, and the probability
is, that all hands would be too much occupied in attempting to save themselves, to keep
them under any discipline. Thus each Torpedo boat would not be more than three minutes
within the line of the enemy's fire.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> It is very easy to make the boats so that they cannot be sunk.</p></div>

<p>I now beg of my reader to meditate on this kind of attack,
and make up his mind on which are in the greatest danger, the six
hundred men in the ship or the six hundred men in the boats?
Are not the chances fifty to one against the ship, that she would be
blown up before she could kill two hundred men in the boats?
Should this appear evident, or be proved by future practice, no
commander would be rash enough to expose his ship to such an
attack.</p>

<p>To give a fair comparative view of the two modes of fighting,
I have, in these calculations, made the number of men on each side
equal; by the same rule, if twenty ships of 80 guns were to come into
one of our ports, we should be necessitated to have one thousand
boats and twelve thousand men; but such a preparation would not
be necessary. It can never be necessary for us to have more boats
than are sufficient to meet the boats which the enemy could put
out to oppose us; an 80 gun ship, which is to work her guns, cannot
be encumbered with many boats; they usually have:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24 </a></span></p>

<table summary="numbers">
<tr>
  <td>1 launch, which is a bad rowing boat,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1 long-boat, which may row well,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1 the captain's barge, a good row-boat,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1 yawl or galley, a good row-boat.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>They may, in some cases, have two more boats, total number,
six; therefore, twelve boats on our part would be sufficient to attack
an 80 gun ship<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>; particularly as all our boats would be built expressly
for running, and our business is to run to harpoon and not
to fight; for this purpose our six oarsmen, in each boat, never quit
their oars, while our four marines keep up a running fire. The
six or eight boats, if the enemy could put out so many, could not
prevent our twelve boats closing on the ship. If our boats came
into contact with the boats of the enemy, the contest would be reduced
to boat fighting; the ship could not use her cannon or small
arms against us without firing on her own boats. If we succeeded
to drive the boats under the guns of the ship, we should follow so
close, that her guns and small arms could not be used, for in the
night and amidst a number of boats in confusion, they could not
discriminate between friends and enemies. On this theory, if
twenty ships of 80 guns, or a force to that amount, were to enter
one of our ports, two hundred and forty boats, with two thousand,
eight hundred and eighty men would be sufficient, and perhaps
more than sufficient, for the attack; and the following view of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25 </a></span>
chances exhibits a strong probability, that such a force of Torpedo
boats and men would destroy the twenty ships of the line within
one hour.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> While organizing a system of Torpedo attack against the Boulogne flotilla, during the
administration of Mr. Pitt, it was determined that men should be taken from Lord Keath's
blockading fleet to man the boats; but a difficulty occurred how to carry a sufficient number of
good active boats. Finding that the ships of war could not take on board more than their
usual number, without being encumbered, four ordnance vessels were to be prepared, with
large hatchways, to receive a number of boats in the hole, and to carry Torpedoes. Lord
Melville was impeached, Mr. Pitt died, and my system was opposed by Lords Grenville and
Howic, and the new administration. I mention this, my experience, to shew that ships of war
cannot carry a sufficient number of boats to contend with the boats which we could bring into
action; they may, indeed, bring with them ordnance ships to carry boats; but, if they unman
the ships to man the boats, the ship will be less formidable in her fire; and I believe it is self-evident,
that they who have to cross three thousand miles of sea, cannot be so well furnished
with boats as we who command the land.</p></div>

<p>Let the attack be in the night. The enemy must be at anchor;
twenty vessels could not keep under way in narrow waters which
could not be well known to their pilots. If they put out their
boats, they could not bring into action more than six good boats
from each ship, total, one hundred and twenty boats. Each ship
would be a point from which their boats could depart, or to which
they could retreat, total, twenty positions; in these twenty positions,
twelve thousand men would be exposed to Torpedo explosion,
which is the same, in effect, as a mine under a fortification.
We, with two hundred and forty boats, exposing only two thousand,
eight hundred and eighty men, would have the whole of our shores
to depart from or retreat to; being the assailants, and having it in
our power to approach in every direction, the enemy could not
know a feint from a real attack, nor could they tell which ship we
would attack first; they, consequently, could not concentrate
their boats; each vessel would be necessitated to keep her own
boats on the look-out, and to aid in protecting her; while we should
have the power to divide our force, or concentre one hundred
boats on one vessel, as circumstances might require; hence, every
thing is in favour of the success of the Torpedo attack, while
the greatest danger is to be apprehended for the ships.</p>

<p>Having given my experience and theory on anchored and harpoon
Torpedoes: a system, which I hope will, by every friend to
America and humanity, be considered of some interest to the
United States. I am aware of the doubts which may arise, as to
the success of harpooning, in the minds of men in general, and
particularly of those who have no experience, who are so impressed
with the imaginary tremendous fire of an 80 gun ship, or a ship of
war, that the question has often been put to me, where will you
find men who have courage to approach in boats within twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26 </a></span>
feet of an 80 gun ship, to harpoon her? I answer, that the men in
the boats, who are not more than three minutes within the line of
the enemy's fire, are not so much in danger, nor does it require so
much courage, as to lie yard-arm and yard-arm, as is usual in naval
engagements, and receive broadsides, together with grape-shot
and volleys of small arms, for forty or sixty minutes. It is not so
great a risque, nor does it require so much courage, as to approach
a vessel in boats, climb her sides, and take her by boarding, yet
this has frequently been done. This risque is not so great, nor
does it require so much courage, as to enter a breach which is defended
by interior works and close ranges of cannon, flanked by
howitzers or carronades loaded with cannister or grape-shot, and
the parapet crowded with infantry; yet such breaches have been
forced, and cities taken by assault, with numerous examples of this
kind. I hope there can be no doubt of sufficient courage to make
a Torpedo attack. In the instances of captain Siccombe and
lieutenant Payne, before mentioned, they considered the risque of
so little importance, that they went to the attack without any
apparent concern; and the sailors, who were offered a few guineas
for each gun of a vessel which they should destroy, used all their
influence with the officers to be permitted to be of the party. But
I will not propose a project so novel, and look to others to execute
it. If Torpedoes be adopted as a part of our means of defence,
with a reasonable number of men organized and practised to the
use of them, if it be thought proper to put such men under my
command, and an enemy should then enter our ports, I will be responsible
to my fellow-citizens for the courage which should secure
success. While I propose this, I wish it to be understood, that I
do not desire any command or public employment. My private
pursuits are the guarantee of an independence and freedom of
action, which is always grateful to my feelings; they are useful and
honourable amusements, and the most rational source of my
happiness.</p>

<p>Having mentioned the ports in which it is most probable the
enemy would attempt to make an impression, calculations can be
made for a like mode of defending other situations&mdash;a <i>minutiae</i>,
which I am not prepared to enter into, nor is it necessary in the
present state of this disquisition. I have shewn a strong power,
in boats and Torpedoes, to defend six of our principal ports.
Gentlemen will please to look to the numbers allotted to each port,
and reflect, whether an enemy would not be inclined to respect a
force so active and tremendous in its consequences; a force, which
under the cover of the night, could follow them into every position
within our waters, and pursue them for some leagues from our
shores into the open sea; yet those establishments would not require
an expenditure of four hundred thousand dollars; for the cutlasses
and fire-arms to arm the boats, and the powder for the Torpedoes,
are already in our arsenals and magazines. And what is
four hundred thousand dollars in a national point of view? A
sum, which would little more than build and fit out for sea two
ships of 30 guns. After reflecting on these experiments and demonstrations,
I hope no one will, for a moment, hesitate in deciding,
that the two thousand, seven hundred Torpedoes and six hundred
and fifty boats, before estimated, will be a better protection for
six of our sea-ports, than two ships of thirty or any other number of
guns. To man the boats in the different ports, nothing more will
be necessary than a marine militia; they can be as numerous as
any possible necessity could require; and should be exercised to
row and use the Torpedoes until the practice became familiar;
after which practice, once a month would be sufficient. Corps
thus formed, would be no expence to the national government;
Torpedoes would require no repairs, and the boats, carefully laid
up in houses built for the purpose, would last many years.</p>

<p>To compare Torpedoes with the usual marine establishments,
and the superior protection which they give, for any specific sum
expended, I have stated this prospect of economy; but I do not
consider economy, in the commencement of such a system, as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29 </a></span>
object of primary importance. Let our fellow-citizens be convinced.
Convince the people of Europe of the power and simple
practice of these engines, and it will open to us a sublime view of
immense economy in blood and treasure. As we are not in actual
hostility, and have no opportunity to try experiments on an enemy,
my opinion is, that we should immediately prepare for such an
event; and to satisfy the public, we should, without loss of time,
make the following experiment:</p>

<p>Purchase a strong ship; make six Torpedoes; build two good
row-boats, and prepare them as for action, with twelve men each.
Let the ship be anchored, and the men practised in harpooning,
throwing the Torpedoes, and observing the action of the tide in
driving them under her bottom. After practising on her while at
anchor, the ship to be got under way in moderate and stiff breezes,
and while under way, the men to row at and harpoon her, letting
the Torpedoes fall into the water, and observing the action of the
current in driving them under her bottom. When the men have
been so exercised as to be certain of harpooning the ship, the Torpedoes
to be charged, a committee appointed, or the whole of congress
witness the effect, the ship to be put under way, the helm
lashed, her men take to the boat, the Torpedo boats advance, harpoon
her, and blow her up. The success of such an experiment will
shew the value of the system; to which courage must be added in
case of an actual engagement.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>On the probable effect of this invention</i></p>


<p>At the time a new discovery is made in physics or mathematical
science, the whole of its consequences cannot be foreseen. In
the year 1330, Bartholomew Schwartz is said to have invented
gun-powder; twenty-five years after, a very imperfect kind of cannon
was constructed of welded bars of iron, others of sheet-iron, rolled
in the form of a cylinder and hooped with iron rings; in some cases,
they were made of leather, strengthened with plates of iron or
copper; balls of stone were used; and it was not until the beginning
of the fifteenth century, that is, one hundred and seventy years
after the invention of powder, that iron balls were introduced into
practice. Muskets were not used until the year 1521, or one hundred
and ninety-one years after the invention of gun-powder. The
Spaniards were the first who armed their foot-soldiers in this manner&mdash;they
had matchlocks; but firelocks, that is, locks with flints,
were not used until the beginning of the eighteenth century, one
hundred and eighty years after the invention of muskets, and
three hundred and eighty years after the invention of powder.
When firelocks were first invented, Marshal Sax had so little confidence
in a flint, that he ordered a match to be added to the lock
with a flint, lest the flint should miss fire<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>: such is the force of habit
and want of faith in new inventions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> I have seen one of these firelocks in the collection of ancient arms, Rue de Bacq. Paris.</p></div>

<p>Although cannon, fire-arms, and the whole detail of ammunition,
now appear extremely simple, yet we here see the very slow
advances to their present state of perfection; and they are still improving:
hence I conclude, that it is now impossible to foresee to
what degree Torpedoes may be improved and rendered useful.
When Schwartz invented powder, it may be presumed that his
mind did not embrace all its consequences, or perceive that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31 </a></span>
discovery would supercede the use of catapultas, armour, bows and
arrows, and totally change the whole art of war. He certainly
could have no conception of such a combination of art as we now
see in ships of the line; those movable fortifications, armed with
thirty-two pounders, and furnished with wings, to spread oppression
over every part of the ocean, and carry destruction to every
harbour of the earth. In consequence of the invention of gun-powder,
ships of war have been contrived, and increased to their
present enormous size and number<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>; then may not science, in her
progress, point out a means by which the application of the violent
explosive force of gun-powder shall destroy ships of war, and give
to the seas the liberty which shall secure perpetual peace between
nations that are separated by the ocean? My conviction is, that
the means are here developed, and require only to be organized and
practised, to produce that liberty so dear to every rational and reflecting
man; and there is a grandeur in persevering to success in
so immense an enterprise&mdash;so well calculated to excite the most
vigorous exertions of the highest order of intellect, that I hope to
interest the patriotic feelings of every friend to America, to justice,
and to humanity, in so good a cause.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> Compared with existing military marines, I consider all galleys and vessels of war, which
were in use previous to the invention of powder, as very insignificant. It is probable that four
74 gun ships in open sea would destroy all that ever existed at any one time.</p></div>

<p>I have shewn that a ship of 80 guns and six hundred men,
could have little chance of resisting fifty Torpedo boats of twelve
men each, equal six hundred men. If it can be admitted possible
that an 80 gun ship will be necessitated to retreat before fifty boats,
she must run so far that the boats cannot follow her, that is, more
than eight or ten leagues; therefore, boats could follow a ship over
the narrow parts of the Baltic or British channel; but I will confine
my remarks to the British channel, between Boulogne and
Romney, from Calais to Dover, and from Ostend to the mouth of
the Thames. If I can shew that in those waters the British fleets
would be compelled to retreat before Torpedo boats or perish, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32 </a></span>
follows, that they must yield to a like system of attack in every
other sea; and the like combination of power which can force them
to yield, will act on all ships of war to their total annihilation.</p>

<p>Let the coast of Boulogne be the scene for action; suppose the
British to have one hundred ships of 80 guns, or a force to that
amount, equal eight thousand guns and sixty thousand men; this
is a greater power than ever has been engaged in one action. I
have mentioned large ships, because the strength of a fleet depends
more on the size of the ships and weight of metal, than on their
number; in such case, the line will not be so much extended as if
the vessels were smaller and more numerous; the signals can be
seen and answered from the extremities of the line with more certainty,
and the order of battle can be better kept. The length of
a ship, from the point of the bowsprit to the stern, may be estimated
at forty fathoms, and the distance between two ships one
hundred fathoms, consequently, the one hundred ships would form
one line of fourteen thousand fathoms, or twenty-eight thousand
yards, equal to near sixteen miles. Such a line could not see and
answer signals from the van and rear to the centre. It could, however,
be formed into four divisions of twenty-five ships each, and
they again could be subdivided; but the tactics which must be adhered
to when two fleets of near equal force engage, will be of
little utility when the attack is made by a sufficient number of Torpedo
boats.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="ESTIMATE" name="ESTIMATE"></a>ESTIMATE OF THE FORCE TO ATTACK SO FORMIDABLE
A BLOCKADING FLEET</p>

<p>Men, sixty thousand, a number equal to the British; they cannot
all be sailors, nor is it necessary they should, but men, who
with six weeks exercise can learn to row well, for to row with tolerable
dexterity, is all the nautical knowledge required. To divide
the sixty thousand men, twelve in a boat, will require five thousand
boats, each of which will be so light, that its twelve men can draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33 </a></span>
it on the beach above high water mark, or on the sands or plane,
in a few minutes, or launch it into the water with equal facility.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="MANNER" name="MANNER"></a>MANNER OF ARRANGING THE BOATS UNTIL WANTED</p>

<p>A boat being six feet wide and twenty-seven feet long, if a
space of twelve feet wide and thirty-nine feet long be allowed for
each boat, four hundred and forty of them would range side by side
in the distance of one mile, then leaving twelve feet from the stems
of the first row to the sterns of the second, and a like space between
each line, the five thousand boats could be laid up on a beach or
plane one mile long, one hundred and fifty yards wide, and give
sufficient room for the men to get at the boats without confusion;
this plan would not require the expence of forming a bason or harbour.
Thus arranged, each boat with its Torpedo, harpoon-guns,
arms, and oars, in their places, and the twelve men in their stations,
six on each side of the boat, the whole could be run into the water
and manned in an hour, which facility of embarking is of the first
importance for rapid movements, and to take advantage of the
weather.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> When the British fleet is becalmed before Boulogne, the French flotilla is becalmed also,
and cannot make any advantageous movements. The calms which lay the British fleet under
great disadvantage, will give every possible advantage to the Torpedo boats, and will be the
most favourable time for the attack.</p></div>

<p>This is equal to 315,000<i>l.</i> sterling or about the value of three
ships of 80 guns; it is equal to 7,560,000 livres, a sum of little importance
to France, it being not equal to the expences of her government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34 </a></span>
for one day; the men she has, and three times the number
if required; the powder for the Torpedoes and arms for the men,
are in her magazines.</p>

<p>Suppose the boats and Torpedoes prepared, the harpooners
exercised, and the men practised to the oars. The intrepidity of
the French, in an assault, has been so often proved, that there can
be no question as to their courage to rush on to the attack in any
case where there is a reasonable hope of success. It is obvious,
that the British ships could not put out a sufficient number of
boats to oppose five thousand Torpedo boats; consequently, they
have not other means of resistance than to manoeuvre and defend
themselves from their ports and decks, in the best manner they
can devise.</p>

<p>It is now necessary, in calculating the chances of success, to
examine various modes of attack and defence; I therefore beg of
the reader, never to lose sight of the facility with which the whole
of the French boats can be run into the water, manned, and ready
for action, or again drawn up on the shore, and with how much ease
every advantage may be taken of calms and favourable circumstances;
he must also separate from his mind the idea of boats attempting
to fight ships; such an attempt would be absurd; it is
Torpedoes, those instruments of instantaneous destruction, which
are to decide the contest; the boats are but the means of harpooning
and attaching the Torpedoes to the ships: this is the whole
object of the attack.</p>

<p>In defence, it is to be considered by what means a ship or ships
could prevent the boats approaching so near as to harpoon them in
the larboard and starboard bow, and make good their retreat? I
will name the calm months of June, July, and August, as most favourable
for the enterprise. Let it be recollected, that in all attacks
of this kind, the boats row at the rate of five miles an hour, or one
hundred and forty-six yards a minute; at the distance of four hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
and thirty-eight yards or three minutes from the ship, they
will risk random round shot<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>; at two hundred and nineteen yards
or one and a half minutes from the ship, they risk one discharge of
grape; at one hundred yards or forty seconds from the ship, they
risk one volley of small arms, before they harpoon. After harpooning,
it is probable the ship's crew would be more occupied
about their own safety, than in standing deliberately to fire at the
boats. And thus, each boat will not be more than four minutes
within the line of the ship's random shot: such rapidity and decision
in attack, gives incalculable advantages to the boats.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> All shot from cannon, carronades, or howitzers, against boats, must be random: a boat is
too small and moves too quick to admit of taking aim; and in the night, musket shot will be
random also.</p></div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="FIRST_MODE" name="FIRST_MODE"></a>FIRST MODE OF ATTACK</p>

<p>In a calm and usually dark night, the ships at anchor, either
in one line or parallel lines, or promiscuously. The Torpedo boats
to be formed into divisions, each division to consist of fifty boats,
and to attack one ship. Suppose the ships first attacked to be
those nearest the land; in a calm they could not get under way,
nor could they change their positions; a ship, by having a spring on
her cable, might possibly bring her broadside to bear on the boats;
but as the fire of the broadside could do little injury until the boats
were within four hundred and thirty-eight yards, or three minutes,
of her bow, and, as three minutes after coming within the line of
fire is to decide the contest, I conceive that her broadside could not
protect her; if the boats, at six hundred yards distance, run for her
bow, it would be impossible for her to change her position so quick
by a spring on her cable, as the boats could change their direction
to keep under her bow. If the ships were in one line, and the headmost
first attacked, she could receive no assistance from the vessel
astern, for she would lie between the stern ship and the boats, and
receive the fire which might be directed for them. If the ships lay
in several parallel lines, or promiscuously, and the next line were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
on her larboard, the larboard ship would be distant at least one hundred
fathoms, and while the boats were bearing down, might fire
broadsides on them when they were at the distance of two hundred
yards; but the moment they closed in with the ship she must cease
her fire, otherwise she would do more injury to the ship than to the
boats; the larboard ship would, therefore, only have an opportunity
to fire two minutes at the boats, in which time, she might
possibly discharge two broadsides; but as the boats could keep in
a line with the bow of the vessel attacked, and there is more danger
from the larboard or starboard ship than the one attacked, a better
mode would be to attack the headmost ship of each line at the
same time; in such case, each ship would be necessitated to reserve
her whole fire for her own defence; she could not assist the next
ship, and thus each vessel would be as much exposed and left to
her own resources, as though there were not another ship within
three leagues of her. The succeeding ships of the line, or lines,
could be attacked in like manner: hence, this mode of attacking
any number of vessels with an equal number of divisions of boats,
amounts to nothing more than a repetition of an attack with fifty
boats on one ship, and it does not appear to me possible, that her
fire could repel fifty boats, or prevent them lodging ten, fifteen,
or twenty harpoons, if necessary, in her larboard and starboard
bow. I leave to nautical men and experienced commanders, to
shew to the public how a ship or ships of war, anchored in a calm
as before stated, could resist such an attack, and their total destruction
in a few hours.</p>

<p>But commanders, seeing the danger of being becalmed while
at anchor, may keep the fleet under way.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="SECOND_MODE" name="SECOND_MODE"></a>SECOND MODE OF ATTACK</p>

<p>In the night, the ships under way, calm, or light breezes of
not more than four knots an hour. Ships of the line, that are
under way, seldom approach nearer each other than a cable's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37 </a></span>
length; this precaution, is to prevent their running foul and causing
confusion; when expecting an enemy of equal force, the custom is
to form one line; admitting, that to oppose the Torpedo boats,
they preserved this usual order of battle, close hauled and under
easy sail, to let the boats come up, here, as in the case of being at
anchor, each ship must apply her whole fire against the division of
boats which attack her; she cannot aid the ship next to her. As
the boats, advancing under cover of the night, each division will,
in three minutes from the time they arrive within danger of cannon
shot, be in with the bow of the destined ship, and fire their
harpoons into her. Therefore it appears, that her chance while
under way is very little better than when at anchor. If, as the
boats advance, a ship turns her bow to meet them, she facilitates
their harpooning her. Will any other order of battle than one
right line, give more security? Would two, three, or four parallel
lines, give better protection? In such case, the line nearest the
boats would be attacked first, and the other lines taken in succession.
Were the ships to form a crescent, the headmost vessels
would be first attacked, in this form, they might surround a number
of boats and get them between two fires; but whatever situation
the boats may be in, after they arrive within the range of grape-shot
they can, in a few minutes, be under the bow of the ship,
where they will be safe from all fire except small arms; but to arrive
under her bow, amounts to a moral certainty of effecting her destruction.
Therefore, with the immense advantage which Torpedoes
give to an attack with boats, it is of little consequence
whether it be made in the night or day, in a calm or a breeze of
from four to six knots. If the ships engage with the boats, their
case will be desperate. In all my reflections on this kind of war,
I see no chance for their escape other than by retreat; and the moment
English ships of war retreat before Torpedo boats, that moment
the power of the British marine is for ever lost, and with it
the political influence of the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span></p>

<p>In this view of chances, I have calculated the number of men
in the boats equal to the number in the ships, and estimated five
thousand boats to be brought into action; but in all cases when
there are sufficient Torpedo boats to drive in the boats of the ships,
there will be sufficient to attack the fleet; the one hundred ships
could not put six hundred good boats in motion, therefore, one
thousand Torpedo boats would suffice for the attack; they could be
formed into fifty divisions of twenty boats each; they would have
every advantage, in a calm, of directing fifty or one hundred boats
against one vessel, while the ships would not have the power to
concentrate their fire on the boats; the ships could not be defended,
unless there were transports or ordinance vessels expressly for
carrying good row-boats, the number of which should be sufficient
to repel the Torpedo boats; but if ships can only be protected by
boats, it follows, that they will cease to be of use, and the contest
for the command of the channel must be decided by boat fighting.
In such case, the nation which could put in action the greatest
number of boats, and was least dependent on commerce, would have
a decided advantage. England is more dependent on commerce
than France; her merchant vessels could be attacked, destroyed,
and her trade ruined; yet the commerce of France could not be
more, nor so much, injured as it is at present. In such an event,
England, who has usurped the dominion of the ocean and laid all
nations under contribution, would be the most humble supplicant
for the liberty of the seas. And then the Emperor of France would
have a noble opportunity to display a magnanimity of soul, a goodness
of heart, which would add lustre to his great actions, and
secure to him the admiration of the civilized world, by granting to
so ingenious, industrious, enterprising, and estimable a people,
a perfect liberty of commerce.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> A government, and particularly a monarchy or aristocracy, may be in the habitual practice
of vice, while the people are in the habitual practice of virtue. In an aristocracy, where
the army, navy, places, and pensions, are in the power of the few, the voice of the people has
little or no influence. The genius, industry, and enterprise of the English, have converted a
barren island into the most fruitful and beautiful spot on earth; their improvements in the useful
arts, have made them the greatest and most useful manufacturing people that ever existed.
In proportion as the people, by their industry, increased the riches of the nation, the government
found a facility in raising revenue, and have loaded the virtuous people with taxes to the
amount of twenty-five or more millions a year, to pay for ruinous wars, the conquest of
America, the establishment of the Bourbons, and the balance of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span></p></div>

<p>I have now run this subject to a conclusion, in which I do not
hesitate to say, that two thousand Torpedo boats and twenty-four
thousand men, would take the command of the British channel
from Boulogne to Romney, from Calais, Gravelines, Dunkirk and
Ostend, to the mouth of the Thames, and that the command of
the commerce of those narrow seas, would command the British
nation; but there the power of Torpedo boats must cease&mdash;a nation
cannot send such boats to sea to depredate on commerce, nor
to foreign countries on expeditions of conquest, and therefore the
seas must be free.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="ON" id="ON">ON</a></p>

<p class="caption4"><i>the imaginary inhumanity of Torpedo war</i></p>


<p>In numerous discussions which I have had on this subject and its
consequences, it has been stated, that instead of giving liberty
to the seas, its tendency would be to encourage piracy and buccaneering,
by enabling a few men in a boat to intimidate and plunder
merchant vessels, thereby producing greater evil than the existing
military marines. This idea, is similar to one which might have
arisen on the invention of muskets, which, giving to an individual
the power of certain death at the distance of fifty or a hundred
yards, robbers might infest the highways, and from an ambush,
shoot the traveller and take his property; yet there is not so much
robbery now as before the invention of gun-powder; society is
more civilized; it is not so much divided into feuds, or clans, to
secrete and protect villainy; and all civilized society will, in their
own defence, combine against the robber, who has little chance to
escape. In like manner, as an individual, instigated by revenge,
might with an air-gun shoot his neighbour, or by means of gun-powder
blow up his barn or buildings; but society combine against
such atrocious acts, and he who would commit them, could have
little other prospect before him than the gibbet. In the case of
pirates or buccaneers, they could not make a Torpedo without
some intelligent workmen, who would be a means of discovery.
Were they to take a prize, they must have some port to carry it to,
or it could be of no use to them; were they to plunder a ship, they
could not carry much in a Torpedo boat, and the boat must have
a port to go to, where neighbours or spectators, observing her
suspicious character, would lead to investigation; added to which,
pirates are seldom constant in their attachment to each other, and
each would suspect the other turning informer. It would be difficult
for a Torpedo boat to depart from any port of America, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> 41 </a></span>
return without being detected. It is certainly much more easy
and secure for an individual to go on the highway and rob, yet
how seldom is that done. When nations combine against pirates,
there is no reason to fear that individuals can make a bad use of
this invention.</p>

<p>But men, without reflecting, or from attachment to established
and familiar tyranny, exclaim, that it is barbarous to blow
up a ship with all her crew. This I admit, and lament that it
should be necessary; but all wars are barbarous, and particularly
wars of offence. It is barbarous for a ship of war to fire into a
peaceable merchant vessel, kill part of her people, take her and the
property, and reduce the proprietor with his family from affluence
to penury. It was barbarous to bombard Copenhagen, set fire to
the city, and destroy innocent women and children. It would be
barbarous for ships of war to enter the harbour of New-York, fire
on the city, destroy property, and murder many of the peaceable
inhabitants; yet we have great reason to expect such a scene of
barbarism and distress, unless means are taken to prevent it; therefore,
if Torpedoes should prevent such acts of violence, the invention
must be humane.</p>

<p>When a fortress is besieged, and a mine driven under the citadel,
the powder laid, and the train ready to light, it is the custom
for the besiegers to send to the commander of the besieged, to inform
him of the preparations, and leave it to his judgment to surrender
or risque the explosion; if he will not surrender after such
warning, and he, with his men, should be blown up, he is to be
charged with the inhumanity, and not the besiegers. Should
government adopt Torpedoes as a part of our means of defence,
the Europeans will be informed of it, after which, should they send
hostile ships into our ports among anchored Torpedoes or Torpedo
boats, and such ships should be blown up, the inhumanity must be
charged to them, and not to the American government or to this
invention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span></p>

<p>Having, in the preceding chapter, given details for a system of
French Torpedo boats, which could command the narrow parts of
the British channel, I may be accused of enmity to England and
partiality to France; yet I have neither hatred nor particular attachment
to any foreign country. I admire the ingenuity, industry,
and good faith of the English people; I respect the arts,
sciences, and amiable manners of the people of France. There is
much in each of those countries which we may copy to great advantage.
But my feelings are wholly attached to my country, and
while I labour for her interest in this enterprise, I am happy that
the liberty of the seas, which I believe can be effected, will not only
benefit America; it will be an immense advantage to England, to
France, and to every other nation. Convinced of this, I have
viewed military marines as remains of ancient warlike habits, and
an existing political disease, for which there has hitherto been no
specific remedy. Satisfied in my own mind, that the Torpedoes
now discovered, will be an effectual cure for so great an evil. To
introduce them into practice, and prove their utility, I am of opinion,
that blowing up English ships of war, or French, or American,
were there no other, and the men on shore, would be humane experiments
of the first importance to the United States and to mankind.</p>

<p>Taking the whole of these fleets, and estimating their expence
by that of the British marine, it must amount to about twenty-six
millions of pounds sterling per annum, equal to 115,555,555
dollars, 50 cents. Can we reflect on this table and not feel, in the
most sensible manner, the folly of the eleven European nations,
who support such establishments for their mutual oppression? Is
there an American who, after viewing these horrid consequences
of divided Europe and her barbarous policy, that can for a moment
harbour a wish, that these happy States should be divided, and each
petty government, in proportion to its resources, augment its fleets
and armies either for defence or to gratify a mad ambition, by depredating
on its neighbours? If there be such men, they are in a
state of political insanity, and the worst enemies to the American
people. The humane and excellent Dean Tucker, in his work on
political economy, published during the American revolution, has
observed, "That the wars of Europe, for the last two hundred years,
have, by the confession of all parties, really ended in the advantage
of none, but to the manifest detriment of all. Suffice it to remark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span>
that had each of the contending powers employed their subjects
in cultivating and improving such lands as were clear of all disputed
titles, instead of aiming at more extended possessions, they
had consulted both their own and their people's greatness much
more efficaciously, than all the victories of a Cesar or an Alexander."
This important truth should be deeply impressed on the mind of
every American.</p>

<p>But I will return to the fleets of Europe, and endeavour to
point out the principal causes of the great increase of those engines
of oppression, and from whence the wealth has arisen to support
such expences. I will also shew the increasing resources which
will, if science does not check it, enable England hereafter to support
a marine of fifteen hundred armed ships, with as much ease as
she now does seven hundred and sixty.</p>

<p>In 1602, the British nation could not possibly have paid for
the expence of such a navy as it possessed in 1701, and in 1701, the
resources of the nation were not equal to the expence of the navy of
1801. The reason is, that since 1602, the sciences have developed
immense resources. Chemistry and mechanics have multiplied
the produce of productive labour, and increased the riches of every
nation in Europe; the commerce of China and the East-Indies has
been opened; Russia and Sweden have become civilized and commercial;
South America, the West India islands, and North America,
have, from a few hundred persons, grown to a population of at
least twenty-five millions; who have created a vast and productive
commerce, of which there was no conception two centuries ago.
Agriculture has every where been improved; the earth produces
more for a given labour; manufactures are carried on, in various
degrees of perfection, in every country and district of country,
which, creating surplus wealth to pay for luxuries, returns millions
of riches on so enterprising and commercial a people as the English,
which, added to their own improvements in mechanism, manufactures,
and agriculture, enables the government, at this day, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
expend thirteen millions of pounds sterling, annually, on their
marine. Yet the people in general live better, have more enjoyments,
and because they have more enjoyments, they are in reality
not more oppressed than the people of 1625, who paid only fifty
thousand pounds to the marine. Such is the natural consequence
of a general cultivation of the useful arts; but a just government
and a wise people, should take care that the wealth which the useful
arts give to them, should not be uselessly expended.</p>

<p>As imports and exports are the consequence of increased population
and industry, the following will shew how the expences of
the British marine have not only kept pace, but gained on her
sources of wealth.</p>

<p>In 1800, the population of the United States was estimated at
5,214,801; with this population, we import from England to the
amount of seven millions sterling per annum, for which we pay, in
direct and circuitous trade, equal seven millions, making our imports
from England, and exports to pay for them fourteen millions,
or equal to one seventh of the imports and exports of England.
Therefore, as it is the profits of trade which support the British
marine, we pay one seventh of its whole expence, or about two
millions sterling, and, in fact, support one seventh of seven hundred
and sixty armed ships, equal 108. Thus we cherish an evil of
which we complain, and unless we can destroy it, we must continue
to nourish it.</p>

<p>In 1700, the population of England and Wales amounted to
5,475,544; in 1800, to 9,343,578; it did not double in the last century
notwithstanding the great increase of trade. As her population is
now equal to one person for every six acres, there is a powerful
check on its increase, and the rational calculation is, that it will not
double, or rise to eighteen millions in the next two centuries. But
the United States is doubling its population in about twenty-five
years, or, for probable correctness, say in thirty years; consequently,
in</p>

<p>This is more than they now send to all the world, which
wealth resulting from American labour, being turned into England,
will increase her resources equal to the maintenance of her present
marine: for, as I before stated, if of seven millions which we now
import, we furnish funds for the seventh part of her naval expences,
or say two millions. Seven is into fifty-six, the imports of
ninety years hence, eight times; the United States will, therefore,
furnish sixteen millions sterling per annum, to support the British
marine, and enable England to double her present naval establishment.
Thus we are continually aiding and supporting, the only
tyranny which can oppress us, or disturb our tranquility.</p>

<p>I am aware that, opposed to this statement, it will be said that
we shall become manufacturers, and hereafter import, in proportion
to our population, less from England; but, in a vast country
like the United States, where lands are cheap, and men can easy be
provided for in agricultural pursuits; it will be difficult for the manufactures
to keep pace with the population. We are now much
greater manufacturers than we were twenty-five years ago; yet our
imports increase; the manufactures of England have augmented
ten fold in the last century. Although her population has not
doubled, yet her exports and imports have kept near even pace
with each other. The consequence of manufactures, is to create
abundance and give the means of purchasing luxuries; therefore,
more persons enjoy the luxuries of fine articles. England has her
manufactures established and her people taught; she has the start
of all the world, which she will keep for very many years; nor can
such superiority be an injury to America, or to France, or any
other nation, provided the profits are not expended on a military
marine to oppress them.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> Then what is to be done to arrest this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span>
enormous evil, this organizing system of oppression? One of
three things must be done: we must have a marine of a force to be
respected, or we must suffer our commerce to be as limited as the
British government may think proper, and be laid under contribution;
or, military marines must be destroyed, and liberty given
to the seas.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> Many appear to be of opinion, that if Bonaparte could get the command of the seas, or
had it in his power, he would reduce London to ashes, and destroy the arts and manufactures
of England. Carthage is always cited as an example of a conqueror's vengeance. This, however,
has never been my opinion, because it is not justified by any act of his life. In all the
countries he has conquered, he has ever respected the sciences and useful arts; he has not
burned Vienna, Berlin, or Madrid. Had he no other motive, his own fame, in a great measure,
depends on the protection which he may give to the sciences. But, independent of this, I
believe he well understands the benefit which Europe receives from English arts and industry;
and his war is not against them, but against the manner in which their profits are applied; that
is, against the marine, and interference of the British government in all the concerns of the
continent.</p></div>

<p>What kind of a marine would obtain for us that consideration
and respect which would give to our merchant ships unmolested
admittance into the ports of Europe? Fifty ships of 80 guns each,
and thirty thousand men, certainly could not guarantee to us such
respect. Russia has a greater naval force, and dare not show a
ship out of the Baltic. Yet fifty such ships would cost the United
States twenty-five millions of dollars, and seven millions of dollars
a year; which, added to repairs, dock-yards, arsenals, navy-boards,
and agents, may be estimated at ten millions a year. But even
could such a marine secure to us a reasonable liberty of commerce,
America could not now bear such an expenditure; and where is the
additional commerce to pay for ten millions a year, expended to
protect it? Should our resources, in twenty years, enable us to
support such a marine, I have shewn, that the British can augment
their fleets also, and spare a force to meet us at sea. But were
America to try her finances to the utmost, and establish a marine
equal to fifty ships of 80 guns, it would be to us the greatest of misfortunes;
for so many persons would become interested in obtaining
a support from it, that, like England, we should continue adding, until
our successors would find it a power superior to their liberty&mdash;one
which would load them with taxes, press their children into senseless
wars, nor leave them permission to complain. Should we ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"> 51 </a></span>
be necessitated to have a marine of a force to be respected, such are
the accumulated evils under which our posterity must suffer. But
if science and energy should sweep military marines from the ocean,
America will be the garden of the world&mdash;an example for Europe
to imitate. When we contemplate the immense sums which are
expended in European marine establishments, and calculate the
infinite good which might have been done with the capital, we have
to lament that man, instead of gratifying his ambition in wars and
devastation, has not sought a more noble and lasting fame in promoting
the arts, the sciences, and civilization.</p>

<p>The annual expence of the navy of Great Britain amounts to
upwards of thirteen millions a year; as long as war continues, the
expence will not be diminished; but taking the chance of war and
peace for the succeeding twenty-five years, and estimate that the
marine will cost ten millions a year, the expenditure in twenty-five
years will be two hundred and fifty millions of pounds sterling.
If driven to have a marine, such might be the expenditure of our
successors; if we can avoid it, the capital might be expended in useful
work. I will now give a short sketch of the improvements which
might be made in America for such a sum:</p>

<p>First, twelve canals, running from the eastern and northern
parts of the United States to the south, each fifteen hundred miles
long, and fifty miles distant from each other, equal to eighteen
thousand miles; thirty canals, running from the sea coast to the
interior, each six hundred miles long and fifty miles apart, or
eighteen thousand miles&mdash;total, thirty-six thousand miles, at three
thousand pounds sterling a mile, amounting to one hundred and
eight millions. Canals to this extent, would intersect a country
fifteen hundred miles long six hundred miles wide, equal nine hundred
thousand square miles, or seven hundred and fifty-six millions
of acres, not an acre of which would be more than twenty-five miles
from canal carriage; and which acres, allowing six to an individual
which is equal to the density of English population, or say seven, allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
for rivers, roads, and canals, would be ample space in a
country which, by its improvements, must be fertile for one hundred
and eight millions of inhabitants.</p>

<p>The two hundred and fifty millions, raised by loan and funded
at five per cent. would, if expended on a marine, lay a tax on the
people of 12,500,000<i>l.</i> sterling a year, equal to 55,555,555 dollars a
year, with a horde of excise-men and tax-gatherers, to torment honest
industry. But if expended on canals, the profits to transport
would pay the interest, and give inconceivable advantages to the
people. Such communications would facilitate every species of
industry. Canals bending round the hills, would irrigate the
grounds beneath, and convert them into luxuriant pasturage.
They would bind a hundred millions of people in one inseparable
compact&mdash;alike in habits, in language, and in interest; one homogeneous
brotherhood, the most invulnerable, powerful, and respectable
on earth. Say, legislators, you who direct the destinies
of this great nation, shall Americans, like servile creatures of established
habits, imitate European vices, or copy them because
they are familiar? Shall they nourish a useless marine, lay the
basis for its increase, and send it down the current of time to futurity
with all its complicated evils? Shall such a system consume
our resources, deprive the earth of improvements, draw into its
vortex ambitious men, divert the best talents of our country from
useful works, and interest them in its support&mdash;creating non-productive
labourers, who must be the consumers of the produce of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span>
the productive class, and diminish their enjoyments? Or will you
search into the most hidden recesses of science, to find a means for
preventing such incalculable evils? And direct the genius and resources
of our country to useful improvements, to the sciences, the
arts, education, the amendment of the public mind and morals.
In such pursuits, lie real honour and the nation's glory; such are
the labours of enlightened republicans&mdash;those who labour for the
public good. Every order of things, which has a tendency to remove
oppression and meliorate the condition of man, by directing
his ambition to useful industry is, in effect, republican. Every
system, which nourishes war and its consequent thousands of idlers
and oppressors, is aristocratic in its effects, whatever may be its
name. These sentiments exhibit my political creed, the object of
all my exertions; and these principles, practised by Americans, will
create for them a real grandeur of character, which will secure to
them the respect and admiration of the civilized world.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
